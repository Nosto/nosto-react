# Coding Instructions for TypeScript/TSX Files

## Coding Standards

- Use closures over classes
- Utilize type inference in return types, except for functions with multiple return statements
- Use utility types to derive types from constants
- Use const (and let) over var
- Avoid 'any' type usage
- Use async/await instead of Promise chaining
- Use individual named exports over bulk exports
- Favor named exports over default exports
