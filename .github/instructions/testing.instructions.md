# Testing Instructions

**applyTo**: "spec/**/*"

## Testing Standards

### Test Framework and Structure
- Use vitest as the test framework
- Use 'describe' and 'it' for test structure
- Use 'beforeEach' for setup
- Use 'afterEach' for cleanup  
- Use 'expect' for assertions
- Test files located in `spec/` directory
- Tests require JSDOM environment for React component testing

### Test Environment Setup
- Tests use JSDOM for browser environment simulation (see `spec/setup.js`)
- React DOM testing with `@testing-library/react`
- Comprehensive test coverage requirements (80% threshold for statements, branches, lines, and functions)

## Running Tests

### Node.js Requirement
- **Node.js 22 or higher required** for optimal test environment
- Tests may fail in isolated sandbox environments due to network dependencies

### Installation
- **Always use**: `npm ci` for dependency installation before running tests
- Ensures proper test environment setup

### Test Commands
- **Run tests**: `npm test` - runs vitest with coverage in silent mode
- **Verbose tests**: `npm run test-loud` - runs tests with full output
- **Test validation**: Always run `npm test` as part of validation process

### Test Coverage
- Coverage thresholds: 80% for statements, branches, lines, and functions
- Coverage configuration in `vite.config.js`
- Coverage reports generated with vitest and v8

## Critical Testing Limitations

### Sandbox Environment Issues
- **Tests fail in isolated environments**: The test suite requires network access to `connect.nosto.com` and missing browser globals
- Test failures in sandbox environments are **EXPECTED** and not indicative of code issues
- **CI Environment**: The GitHub Actions CI pipeline (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) runs tests successfully with proper environment setup

### Expected Behavior
- Tests pass in full CI environment with Node.js 22
- Local development environment with proper network access should pass tests
- Sandbox/isolated environments will show test failures - this is normal

## Pre-commit Testing Process

### Validation Requirements
- Run `npm test` as part of pre-commit validation
- Address any legitimate test failures (not environment-related ones)
- Maintain test coverage above 80% threshold
- Use conventional commit format for test-related changes
- **Important**: Use `git commit --no-verify` to avoid Husky pipeline errors

## Test File Organization

### Test Directory Structure
- `spec/` - All test files
- `spec/setup.js` - Test environment setup with JSDOM
- `spec/mocks/` - Mock data and utilities
- Test files follow `*.spec.ts` or `*.spec.tsx` naming convention

### Testing Dependencies
- `@testing-library/react` - React component testing
- `@testing-library/jest-dom` - Jest DOM matchers
- `@testing-library/user-event` - User interaction simulation
- `vitest` - Test runner and assertions
- `@vitest/coverage-v8` - Coverage reporting
- `jsdom` - Browser environment simulation
